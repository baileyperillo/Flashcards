## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This project was particularly hard for me because I have never made my own flashcards in code before.
So I had to do a lot of extra research on how to do the project. I felt like there were more steps beyond
what we learned in the lesson because of this. I found it difficult to connect everything together.
This would include making sure my code was working properly, I was spelling everything correctly, and
everything was connecting. When I didn't I would just have an empty screen and have to go through tedious
work to figure out what is wrong and most of the time my code is correct. I think I struggled with time
the most. I had a lot of things happening this week and thought I could complete the work in the same
amount of time as the previous project but was wrong.
